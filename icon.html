    <p class="icons">Continuing with his concept from Versions (2010), Laric resumes with the idea of Kopienkritik as he showcases Greek sculptures alongside Roman statues. Taking a damaged reformation icon from St Martin’s Cathedral in Utrecht, Netherlands, Laric created a silicone mould from its remains. He teamed with 3D modellers and created a series of casts from the mould. Each would become a Polyurethane sculpture, sizing and standing at 29.4 x 16.5 x 10.5 cm. All would be identical except for the colours incorporated onto them. Along with the idea of Kopienkritik, Iconoclasm can be seen at the works within this exhibition. </p>

     <p class="icons">According to The University of Chicago, Iconoclasm is “a contestation over- and destruction of- images coinciding with a belief in the fallacious nature of their representation.” it is used in the destruction of sacred or religious pieces and with the intent to make a statement regarding a conflict politically or religiously. These sculptures illustrate the questioning of the hierarchy between what is original and copied. Why is it that the original always gets prayed and deemed as more authentic? These renditions of the same sculptures show how copies can be just as valid as the original.</p>
