     <p class="versions">Versions (2010) is one of the three iterations produced from the same video essay over the course of 2009 to 2012. In the past, it has been displayed in the MIT exhibitions and Seventeen Gallery, London exhibition.  It has been regarded as “a celebration of visual culture as a collective, social project, historically and in the internet-enabled present.” (Net Art Anthology, Rhizome). Versions plays into his theme of copyright as it includes texts taken from various artists within the essay. The video is narrated by a synthesized female presenting voice, who reads text from Laric's own writing. During this, a “series of sculptures, airbrushed images of missiles, a talk, a PDF, a song, a novel, a recipe, a play, a dance routine, a feature film and merchandise” (Karen Archey, Rhizome).</p>

    <p class="versions">Versions plays into his theme of copyright as it includes texts taken from various artists within the essay.

During this, a “series of sculptures, airbrushed images of missiles, a talk, a PDF, a song, a novel, a recipe, a play, a dance routine, a feature film and merchandise” (Karen Archey, Rhizome). A still from Versions at the 9:06 minute mark of the video, demonstrates how even large corporations, such as Disney, participate in this trend of copying. The still shows how the same sketch was used for Winnie the Pooh as it was for The Jungle King. In another frame from the video (9:06 minutes), various statues are shown alongside one another, which are Greek and Roman. This is done to show how the Roman statues mimic the Greeks' design. This highlights the idea of Kopienkritik (“copy criticism”). Laric states the more iterations and copies of art he sees,“ the more respect I have for their capacities to welcome, to gather, to recollect meaning, and sanctity.” (Versions, 2010). </p>
